# Language Processing Algorithms

A comprehensive suite of algorithms for natural language processing (NLP) and linguistic analysis. This repository provides implementations for various language processing tasks, enabling researchers and developers to efficiently analyze and understand textual data.

## Features

- Tokenization and text normalization
- Part-of-speech tagging
- Named entity recognition
- Text classification
- Sentiment analysis
- Customizable pipeline architecture

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Photonicnova101/language-processing-algorithms.git
cd language-processing-algorithms
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can use the provided scripts and modules directly or integrate them into your own NLP projects.

Example:

```python
from nlp_algorithms import TextProcessor

processor = TextProcessor()
result = processor.analyze("Natural Language Processing is fascinating!")
print(result)
```
